# Systems Design
Business Analysis and Systems Design is the study of concepts, processes and tools that professionals use to plan 
and develop information systems to industry standards. COMP 2831 continues the established Systems Analysis tradition 
and provides the foundation for all BCIT Computing development credentials. Students learn how to ask implicit questions,
to create and document communication plans and to make better decisions prior to creating an information system.
Beginning with an introduction to the SDLC, Software Development Life Cycle, students work in teams to initiate the system process,
analyze problems, discover requirements and create a logical design. Topics include: techniques used in the discovery
of business requirements, traditional approaches to data and process modelling. There is an overview of Object Oriented Modelling
techniques using the Unified Modelling Language (UML) as well as an introduction to Project Management.
Agile frameworks including XP, Extreme Programming, and SCRUM are also introduced. Students learn to work in groups to provide
detailed written materials and make presentations of their designs. By the end of this course, successful participants will
be able to use industry standard tools and methods to analyze, design, and implement information systems.
Students who complete COMP 2831 will be prepared to move on to COMP 2833 Agile Software Development with Scrum and the
Agile Development Associate Certificate.

Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:

<ul>
<li>Explain and use the various phases of the SDLC, (Software Development Life Cycle).</li>
<li>Describe some of the key features in current trends in system development: RAD, RUP, Agile & BPM, Business Process Management.</li>
<li>Explain the term "Agile Software Development".</li>
<li>Discover and define system requirements using the appropriate technique(s).</li>
<li>Develop use case diagrams and scenario descriptions.</li>
<li>Read, interpret and develop models that can be incorporated with Business Process Management.</li>
<li>Explain how Use Case Modelling and WorkFlow Analysis work together to define functional system requirements.</li>
<li>Develop a project schedule using PERT and GANTT charts.</li>
<li>Construct a cost benefit analysis to determine the feasibility of a project.</li>
<li>Identify and analyze the data entities and objects needed in a system using both Information Engineering and OO techniques with UML.</li>
<li>Design a technical architecture system "blueprint".</li>
<li>Design appropriate user interfaces following Human Engineering design principles.</li>
<li>Identify the required integrity controls for inputs, outputs, data and processing.</li>
<li>Describe implementation and support activities.</li>
<li>Identify appropriate formats for system documentation.</li>
<li>Prepare and present a system proposal in a team environment.</li>
</ul>
